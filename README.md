# Tesladin

## Service where a user can send a file to via the curl command.

## After sending the file, the service will respond with a url so you can download that file.

## If the user loses the url..... YIKES.

## This project is a challenge. Only the official Go docs found [here] (https://go.dev/#) can be used as reference material to build this project. No Youtube, no Google, no ChatGPT, just me and the docs baby.

#### To run the service execute "make run".
