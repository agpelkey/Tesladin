## Service that an end user can send files to via curl.

## After sending the file, the service will respond with a url so you can download that file.

## If the user loses the url..... YIKES.

## This project is a challenge. Only the official Go docs found [here] (https://go.dev/#) can be used as reference material to build this project. No Youtube, no Google, no ChatGPT, just me and the docs baby.
