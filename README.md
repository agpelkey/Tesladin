# Tesladin

## Service where a user sends a file via the curl command, and gets a response with a URL. The user can then re-download the file via the URL.

## If the user loses the URL..... YIKES.

## This project is a challenge. Only the official Go docs found [here](https://go.dev/#) can be used as reference material to build this project. No Youtube, no Google, no ChatGPT, just me and the docs baby.

#### To run the service execute "make run".
